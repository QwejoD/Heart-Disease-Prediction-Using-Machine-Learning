# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## This project was inspired by an online (Youtube) ML series
The series can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmqCYC-MBQo&list=PLJxgi_hKeWvW3eTCgTaEIq38sxOOcznBL&index=16

In this project, the knowledge and methods of  Machine Learning were applied to generate models capable of predicting heart disease.

The Logistic Regression model in pytorch and AutoGluon were employed in model genereation.

3 project files:
* Jupyter notebook with code run to completion
* Dataset for the project
Dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle
